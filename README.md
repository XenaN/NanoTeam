Nanomaterial toxicity prediction 

NanoTech is the project within the AI Talent Hub hackathon, the task of which was to create a product with an MVP on a relevant topic. In this case, our team chose the scientific theme of biotech. The main task that we solved was to create a service for researchers working in the field of nanotechnologies. This service predicts the toxicity of a nanomaterial based on the description of the material itself relative to a living cell. Such a service can help reduce the choice of materials to solve their problems, reducing costs significantly.

Experts provided us with data that is not included in this repository. This data is cleaned and preprocessed. The model is trained on the received data and saved, then it makes predictions on the selected parameters on the site.
